I'm a PhD student at [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu/web/campus/campus-poblenou) in Barcelona.

# What I Do?  
**Audio-visual analysis!:** audio inpainting, cross-model generation, lip reading, video inpaining, [Blind Source Separation](https://ipcv.github.io/Acappella/).  

# How do I do it?  
Well... I work on academia so I don't have many resources. I work with Graph-CNNs and Transformers nor encoder-decoders! This is fast, cheap and reaches SOTA results!  

# Nice people around
I do belong to the [Music Technology Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg) and to the [Image Processing Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/knowledge/-/research-group-image-processing-group-gpi-), being co-supervised by the Dr. Emilia GÃ³mez and the Dr. Gloria Haro.  
Special acknowledgment to Olga Slizovskaia, great researcher and better person for being my menthor in this competitive world.  

# Who I am outside the lab?  
I do love Mountains, I've been in the Amazonas, climbed volcanoes, do canyoning, treeking or ski. Eat bugs, termites or ants sometimes :/
