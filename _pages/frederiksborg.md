## Things to take into account  
* **Lunch:** We can have lunch in several places in the castle. Please bring your food.  
* **Adquiring tickets in advance:**  Do it [here](https://dnm.dk/en/tc-events/entry/) if you are coming for sure. This saves time.   
* **Don't be late**: Don't know how many people will go but it's difficult to manage large groups.  
* 
From Hillerød town centre you can sail the most beautiful nautical mile in Denmark on the Castle Lake at Frederiksborg Castle. 
The little ferry sails from Hillerød Torv to the Baroque Garden and the trip takes about 30 minutes. 
The ferry sails when the flag is flying at the landing stages of both Hillerød Torv and the Baroque Garden. 
The trip costs DKK 30 for adults and DKK 10 for children.
