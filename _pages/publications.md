<summary>Brief description</summary>
<p>
We explore the single-channel singing voice separation problem from a multimodal perspective, by jointly learning from audio and visual modalities.  
We propose a model which makes use of Graph convolutional neural networks to contrain a U-Net, a encoder-decoder architecture.  
We evaluate:  
  i) presence of overlapping voices in the audio mixtures  
  ii) the target voice set to lower volume levels in the mix  
  iii) combination of i) and ii). The third one being the most challenging evaluation setup. We demonstrate that our model outperforms the baseline models in the singing voice separation task in the most challenging evaluation setup.
