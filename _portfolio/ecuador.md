I discovered something really funny. sftp protocol is affected by latency. In short, no matter how fast your connection is, it will be shit if you transfer files between continents :/
A speed test to the optimal server reveals a ping of 20-30 ms and a broadwidth of ~5Mbps, faaar away from the 600 Mbps I enjoy in my hometown. Still stable enough to work with the lovely python's remote kernel.
